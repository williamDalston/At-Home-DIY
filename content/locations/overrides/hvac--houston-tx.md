## HVAC Services Tailored for Houston's Climate

Houston's hot, humid climate puts extreme demands on your HVAC system. With temperatures regularly exceeding 95°F and humidity levels above 70%, your air conditioning works harder and longer than in most U.S. cities. Choosing the right HVAC professional in Houston means finding someone who understands the unique challenges of the Gulf Coast climate.

## Why Houston Homes Need Specialized HVAC Care

### Humidity Control Is Critical

Standard cooling isn't enough in Houston — your HVAC system must also manage humidity. High indoor humidity promotes mold growth, damages wood furnishings, and makes your home feel warmer than it actually is. Houston HVAC professionals should be well-versed in:

- **Variable-speed air handlers** that run longer at lower speeds for better dehumidification
- **Whole-home dehumidifiers** as an add-on to your central system
- **Proper refrigerant charge** — an overcharged or undercharged system won't dehumidify effectively

### Sizing Matters More in Houston

An oversized system in Houston is a common and costly mistake. Oversized units cool quickly but cycle off before removing enough humidity, leaving your home clammy. A Manual J load calculation is essential for proper sizing, accounting for Houston's 30 BTU-per-square-foot baseline.

### Common Houston HVAC Considerations

- **SEER ratings**: In south Texas, a minimum SEER 16+ system pays for itself through lower bills. Many Houston homeowners opt for SEER 18-20 units.
- **Pier-and-beam homes**: Ductwork under the house is exposed to Houston's humid crawl space, leading to condensation and energy loss. Duct sealing and insulation are critical.
- **Hurricane preparedness**: Secure your outdoor condenser unit and consider a surge protector to prevent damage from power fluctuations during storms.
