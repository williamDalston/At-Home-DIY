  - question: "How often should I service my HVAC system?"
    answer: "Have your HVAC system professionally serviced twice a year — once in spring (for cooling) and once in fall (for heating). Replace air filters every 1-3 months depending on the filter type and whether you have pets."
  - question: "What is the most important home maintenance task?"
    answer: "Addressing water issues is the single most important maintenance priority. Water damage from leaks, poor drainage, or gutter problems can lead to mold, structural damage, and costly repairs. Regularly inspect your roof, gutters, plumbing, and foundation for signs of water intrusion."

## Why Seasonal Maintenance Matters

Regular home maintenance prevents small problems from becoming expensive emergencies. A neglected gutter leads to water damage. A dirty HVAC filter leads to system failure. A small roof leak leads to mold.

This checklist organizes tasks by season so you can stay ahead of issues all year long.

## Spring Checklist

Spring is the time to address winter damage and prepare for warmer months.

### Exterior

- Inspect the roof for missing, cracked, or curling shingles — binoculars work well from the ground
- Clean gutters and downspouts of debris; check for proper drainage away from the foundation
- Inspect the foundation for new cracks; seal any gaps
- Power wash siding, decks, patios, and walkways
- Check exterior caulking around windows and doors; recaulk where needed
- Inspect the driveway and walkways for frost heave damage
- Service the lawn mower and outdoor power equipment
- Turn on exterior hose bibs and check for freeze damage

### Interior

- Replace HVAC filters and schedule a professional AC tune-up
- Test all smoke and carbon monoxide detectors; replace batteries
- Check the water heater for signs of corrosion or leaks; flush the tank
- Inspect the attic for signs of winter leaks, pests, or inadequate ventilation
- Clean or replace range hood filters
- Check washing machine hoses for bulges or cracks; replace if older than 5 years
- Deep clean kitchen appliances (oven, dishwasher, refrigerator coils)

## Summer Checklist

Summer focuses on outdoor upkeep and preparation for heavy use.

### Exterior

- Trim trees and shrubs away from the house, keeping branches at least 3 feet from the roof
- Inspect and repair deck boards, railings, and stain/seal the deck if needed
- Check irrigation systems for leaks and proper coverage
- Inspect window screens and repair or replace damaged ones
- Clean and maintain the grill and outdoor cooking areas
- Ensure proper grading — soil should slope away from the foundation
- Check the exterior dryer vent for lint buildup and blockages

### Interior

- Check the AC refrigerant lines for insulation damage
- Clean ceiling fans (they collect dust quickly)
- Inspect the garbage disposal — clean with ice cubes and citrus peels
- Test the garage door auto-reverse safety feature
- Check all interior caulking in bathrooms and kitchen; recaulk to prevent water damage
- Organize and inspect the garage or basement for moisture issues

## Fall Checklist

Fall is critical for winterizing your home before cold weather arrives.

### Exterior

- Clean gutters again after leaves fall (this is the most important gutter cleaning of the year)
- Inspect the roof one more time before winter
- Disconnect, drain, and store garden hoses
- Shut off exterior water supply and drain hose bibs to prevent freezing
- Seal gaps and cracks around the foundation, windows, and doors
- Have the chimney inspected and cleaned if you use a fireplace
- Apply weather stripping to exterior doors
- Aerate and fertilize the lawn; seed bare patches
- Store outdoor furniture or cover it for winter

### Interior

- Schedule a professional furnace/heating tune-up
- Replace HVAC filters
- Reverse ceiling fans to clockwise (pushes warm air down)
- Test the thermostat — consider upgrading to a programmable or smart model
- Check insulation in the attic; add more if less than 12 inches
- Bleed air from hot water radiators if applicable
- Check weather stripping around doors and windows
- Stock emergency supplies (flashlights, batteries, bottled water, blankets)

## Winter Checklist

Winter is about monitoring, preventing damage, and tackling indoor projects.

### Exterior

- Keep gutters clear of ice dams — use a roof rake to remove snow buildup near eaves
- Monitor the roof for ice dam formation after heavy snow
- Keep walkways clear and salted to prevent slip hazards
- Check that the sump pump is functioning (test by pouring water into the pit)
- Inspect exterior pipes and insulation

### Interior

- Check for drafts around windows and doors; apply temporary insulation if needed
- Keep interior temperatures above 55 degrees F even when away to prevent frozen pipes
- Open cabinet doors under sinks on exterior walls during extreme cold
- Monitor humidity levels (30-50% is ideal in winter) to prevent both dry air damage and condensation
- Test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors again (high-risk season for CO)
- Check the fire extinguisher expiration date
- Inspect the water heater pressure relief valve
- Plan any major spring projects and get contractor quotes (off-season pricing may be lower)

## Monthly Tasks (Year-Round)

Some tasks should be done every month regardless of season:

- Test smoke detectors (press the test button)
- Check HVAC filters and replace if dirty
- Inspect under sinks for leaks
- Run water in rarely used fixtures to prevent drain traps from drying out
- Check exterior for any new damage or issues
- Clean the kitchen garbage disposal

## Annual Professional Inspections

Some maintenance requires professional expertise. Schedule these annually:

- **HVAC service** (twice per year — spring and fall)
- **Chimney inspection** (before heating season)
- **Roof inspection** (spring, or after any severe storm)
- **Pest inspection** (spring)
- **Septic system pumping** (every 3-5 years if applicable)
