  - question: "How long does a roof last?"
    answer: "Three-tab asphalt shingles last 15-20 years. Architectural shingles last 25-30 years. Metal roofing lasts 40-70 years. Clay or concrete tile lasts 50-100 years. These estimates assume proper installation and adequate ventilation."
  - question: "How do I know if I need a roof repair or replacement?"
    answer: "Consider repair if damage is limited to a small area and the roof is under 15 years old. Consider replacement if the roof is near end of life, more than 25% of the surface is damaged, there are multiple active leaks, or shingles are curling across large areas."
