## Choosing a Painter

1. **Insurance** — General liability is essential to protect against property damage.
2. **References and portfolio** — Ask to see photos of recent completed projects.
3. **Written estimate** — Should specify paint brand and sheen, number of coats, surface prep, and timeline.
4. **Surface preparation** — A good painter spends as much time on prep as on painting. Ask about their prep process.
5. **Warranty** — Look for at least a 2-year workmanship warranty.
